19 Oct-
Hi Sean! I started cleaning my casualty data and overlooked submitting this part on time for assignment 2 (3?). Anyways, here it is!
I’ve seen some stories on cause of death trends within the military, mostly related to the number of CONUS/non-combat deaths that have to do with training accidents (vehicle rollovers, aircraft mishaps, etc) or drug overdoses. 
I haven’t seen any focus on the number of CONUS deaths that focus on deaths without a cause of death listed (“pending”). I’m not certain what the story is, but I’ve got a lot of deaths listed as “pending” in my spreadsheet. 
I’ve been struggling to think about what other data sets I could use to look into this. There’s some GAO reports on training death rates, and military casualty numbers are updated (daily??) online. 
I suppose I could lean on some census bureau data??? But I’m not sure how I would use that. 
For the command climate surveys- I like what you said about going through them first and narrowing down specific questions to ask of the data. I think I mentioned last week but turns out I actually have all the data possible to have in 2023 (or so they say). I think it’s over 1000 pages?? Or at least enough for me to want to tackle it with a decent plan in mind for efficiency.
