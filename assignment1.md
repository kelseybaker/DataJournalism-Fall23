## I looked at two recent WSJ reports. The main story is “Children are dying in ill-prepared emergency rooms across America”. It’s complemented with a piece called “Find hospitals deemed ready to treat children in your area.”

# Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations. YES 5

##What was it? That not all ERs are created equally when it comes to kids, and it’s a matter of life/death

##Was it in the headline? Yes, easy to grasp

##Was that the most efficient way to navigate the visualization? The reporters created a map in the “find hospitals” piece that I thought was pretty fascinating and easy to use. You insert your zip code and a list will appear with hospitals that are adequately prepared to treat children. 

##Can you suggest ways to improve navigation? Yes- while I liked the interactive map, I don’t like how the long list of hospitals (including those hundreds of miles away) felt cumbersome. Listing two or three might have been more helpful/kept things more organized.

##Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 3.5

##List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data- 

##The story notes that WSJ reporters were not able to get their hands on government data for hospitals due to ‘confidentiality’. 
State certification levels- I think they could have elaborated more on what “certification” means.

##Did they provide a source? Yes

##Did they explain everything that needed explaining?
I would like to know more about why their requests to which? Gov agency for those hospital assessment records were denied. 
The report cites JAMA research that shows 1440 children died in 983 ERs because the ERs were poorly prepared, between 2012 to 2017. I think they could have highlighted if deaths were concentrated in specific hospitals or regions, and why. 
About 1,440 children died from 2012 to 2017 because the emergency rooms that treated them weren’t well prepared, according to a study of 983 E.R.s published in January by JAMA Network Open.

##Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)

##Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made. (I hit on this in the “Creativity” section- overall I think the quality is good but there is room for more data collection and analysis).

##Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?

##Did it: Look like it all belonged together? 5

##Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information? 5
Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue? 5
Overall I liked the graphics used. The “complexity of intubating a child” graphic was really helpful and straightforward. It’s not a graphic displaying data, but is instead a picture graphic comparing adult versus child airway size/complexity. Size makes sense to me without seeing the graphic, but I thought the graphic added value by showing how they are actually structured differently due to age. 
Type (1-5)
5- in this case, I think a minimalistic approach to type is helpful. The phrases used add value to the picture. 
Color (1-5)
4- airways are easy to spot and are blue. Maybe so much gray is a little boring though?? Or maybe it’s nice because it makes airways easier to see. 
Creativity
Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you? 4
I thought the map and the airway graphic were well done and helpful. Aside from the lists in map results sometimes being unhelpful (if I know a quality hospital is 50 miles away from my home in Wilmington, NC, I don’t really need to know about the three that are 100-150 miles away).
I think they should have had graphics to show any concentration of deaths (by hospital or by state/region). Also, of the 1440 deaths listed in JAMA research, whether or not the deaths rose, fell, or remained steady between 2012 and 2017.
